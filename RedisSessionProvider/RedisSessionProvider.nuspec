RedisSessionProvider is a class library for persisting ASP.NET Session data to a Redis server. It is
non-locking, meaning that multiple request threads can access the same Session object if multiple
requests come in with the same Session ID. This allows for parallel requests but can result in race
conditions if used improperly. 

Please visit the project page at https://github.com/welegan/RedisSessionProvider for a more detailed 
explanation of this and other behaviors.

=================== Version Changelog ===================

V1.2.8: Updated Json.NET dependency to 6.03, StackExchange.Redis to 1.0.322

V1.2.7: Bug Fixes: values in Session_Start global asax events were not being written to Redis, they should now
correctly persist. Redis TTL expiration times on all hashes are now always set (first-load sometimes did not
set them)

V1.2.6: RedisSessionAccessor's Session object now implements HttpSessionStateBase.SessionID

V1.2.5: RedisSessionConfig now has a RedisWriteFieldDel and a RedisRemoveFieldDel for cases where you want
to perform an action any time a hash key is changed or removed. Minor improvement to RedisJSONSerializer that
will save some space in Redis hash if you store lots of bools or bytes in session

V1.2.4: RedisSessionConfig now has a RedisSessionAccessorExceptionLoggingDel property for logging errors in
RedisSessionAccessor. RedisConnectionConfig now has a GetSERedisServerConfigDbIndex property for specifying
database index.

V1.2.3: RedisSessionAccessor now returns a subclass of HttpSessionStateBase for its Session property so that
it is more easily used.

V1.2.2: Added RedisSessionAccessor class, allowing WebAPI and non-standard pipelines to use RedisSessionProvider.
usage details on project page.

V1.2.1: Now using StackExchange.Redis.ConfigurationOptions internally for handling connection data
Updated StackExchange.Redis package reference

V1.2.0: Redis client changed from BookSleeve to StackExchange.Redis
IRedisSerializer method signatures changed to better mesh with the new SE.Redis client calls
Various improvements to speed and memory usage
TwemProxy support added (by SE.Redis)
Added some unit tests, click project site link for details

=================== StackExchange.Redis Client Library Above ===================

Please note that BookSleeve is now abandoned in favor of StackExchange.Redis. However, since SE.Redis was only
released in March of 2014, I've decided to leave the latest BookSleeve implementation available. I highly
recommend you move to the SE.Redis version, though.

=================== BookSleeve Redis Client Library Below ===================

V1.1.2: Now partially covered by unit tests, improved some necessary locking behavior, minor edge case fixes

V1.1.1: Added a maximum session size property to RedisConnectionConfig, and delegate that gets called when
size is exceeded.

V1.1.0: Updated to provide better multi-threaded behavior, now using a shared local cache as a middle layer
between request and Redis

V1.0.*: Initial Release, see https://github.com/welegan/RedisSessionProvider for details
